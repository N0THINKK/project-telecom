## Overview

Telecom Churn Prediction is a data science project that aims to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers leave the company's services for various reasons, such as switching to a competitor or discontinuing the service altogether. This project uses machine learning techniques to identify factors that contribute to churn and build predictive models to anticipate customer attrition.

## Project Description

In this project, we analyze historical customer data to:

- Explore and preprocess the dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into customer behavior.
- Create predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
- Evaluate the performance of the models and choose the best one.
- Deploy the chosen model for real-time predictions or use it to identify customers at risk of churn.

## Data

The dataset used for this project can be found in the `data` directory. It contains the following columns:

- `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `contract_duration`: The duration of the customer's contract.
- `monthly_charges`: The amount the customer is charged monthly.
- `total_charges`: The total amount charged to the customer.
- `churn`: The target variable indicating whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0).

## Installation
